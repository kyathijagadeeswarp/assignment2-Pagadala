###### Chess

Chess is a board game between two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games, such as xiangqi (Chinese chess) and shogi (Japanese chess).

**Nobody ever won a chess game by resigning.**

**The blunders are all there on the board, waiting to be made.**
